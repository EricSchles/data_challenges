I'm being a bit hand wavy here, but a good example of what I'm talking about presents itself with morgan stanley.  If you run the below code and then access the `employer_counts` dict like so:\n",

    "Digging in a bit to the code - one of the things you'll notice about `clean_split` - my preprocessing function, I remove some obvious words that are likely to appear quiet a bit.  Since these are company names, they add little value to the canonicalization process, therefore they are removed.  The next thing to note is my use of named entity recognition from `spacy`.  There entity tagger allows me to remove useless common words.  If the label \"ORG\" is attached to the entity, we simply include that in names to check.  \n",

    "Stepping back a bit, to see what the overall goal of the code is - the high level goal is simple, determine which businesses occur multiple times, under slightly different names.  If we knew all the semantic organizations, like we know MORGAN STANLEY then we could simply check for that sub-string in all the other business names.  Unfortunately we don't, so we simply try to mimic that functionality generally, via these `ORG` entities we pulled out earlier.  Looping over each word, checking for each substring we believe to be an `ORG`, we are able to approximate what all the unique employer names are.  These are stored in the keys of `employer_counts`.
